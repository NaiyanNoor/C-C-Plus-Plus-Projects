Header Files: #include <stdio.h>, #include <stdlib.h>, #include <string.h>, and #include <time.h> are used for input/output, memory management, string operations, and seeding the random number generator, respectively.
Constants: #define MAX_TRIES 6 sets the maximum number of incorrect guesses.
Word Selection: An array of words is defined. A random word is selected using rand() % numWords.
Guessed Letters Array: An array guessed keeps track of which letters in the word have been guessed.
Game Loop: The main loop continues until the word is guessed or the player runs out of tries. The player inputs a letter, and the program checks if the letter is in the word.
Printing Functions: printWord() displays the current state of the guessed word. isWordGuessed() checks if all letters have been guessed. printHangman() displays the hangman diagram based on the number of incorrect guesses.
Compilation and Execution
To compile and run the program, follow these steps:

Save the code to a file, for example, hangman_game.c.
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the file.
Compile the program with gcc -o hangman_game hangman_game.c.
Run the program with ./hangman_game.
This code provides a basic structure for a word-guessing game. You can expand it with more words, additional features, or a more complex user interface.
